# Intro

What is this game about? How many players?

# Objective

During the game, players buy new cards to add to their personal deck of cards. Each card has an associated victory point value. At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points in his deck at the end of the game is the winner. 

# Components

40 cards, divided into 4 suits (green, red, pink, blue) of 10 cards each.

A sample card is shown below. The number in the top-left-hand corner is the **bid value**. The number in the laurel wreath is the card's **victory point (VP) value**. The text beneath the VP value is the card's **special power**.

Note that only cards with a bid value between six and ten have a special power. 

# Set-up

# Gameplay
## Overview
A round consists of the following phases:
1. Discard unwanted card from hand (both players)
2. Bid (both players simultaneously)
3. Play special power cards (each player in turn)
4. Buy cards from auction display (first winner of bid, then loser)
5. Restock auction display
6. Draw new hand of cards 

## Discard unwanted card
From their starting hand of five cards, a single card is discarded *face down* and *on top of their personal deck* (**not** into their discard pile). 

## Bidding
From their remaining hand of four cards, players play up to four cards to bid for the right to purchase from the auction display before their opponent. The suit of the bid card is irrelevant at this stage. A player does not have to play any bid cards.

Bid cards are played face down and revealed simultaneously. The total value of a players's bid is the sum of each bid card's bid value. The player with the higher bid is the winner.

If the players' total bids tie, each player must add the top card from their personal deck to their bid. The bid values are then compared. If the bids still tie, another card is taken from the top of the personal decks, and so on. 

## Using powers
The winner of the bid may then play any card(s) left in their hand for their special power(s).

When a special power card is played


Cash in any card of same suit or change a card's suit,
Duplicate a power or change a card's suit,
Take card of same suit from auction discards,

## Purchasing
## Restocking the auction lay
## Drawing a new hand of cards

# End of the game

The game ends when there auction deck has been exhausted, and either there are no remaining auction display cards, or neither of the two players wants to purchases the ones that remain.

At this point, players add their discards to their personal deck and add up their total VPs. In addition, a bonus ten VPs is awarded for any suit which a player has at least six of.

The player with the most victory points is the winner. If players are tied for the highest score, the player with the fewest cards wins.
