# Intro

What is this game about? How many players?

# Objective

During the game, players buy new cards to add to their personal deck of cards. Each card has an associated victory point value. At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points in his deck is the winner.

# Components

Dutch comprises just 40 cards, divided into 4 suits (green, red, pink, blue) of 10 cards each.

All ten cards from the red suit are shown below. The number in the top-left-hand corner is the **bid value**. The number in the laurel wreath is the card's **victory point (VP) value**. The text beneath the VP value on is the card's ** power**.

![Complete blue suit](diagrams/complete_suit.png????)

All suits are identical in respect to their bid values, victory points and powers.

Each suit has two power cards, indicated by a lightning symbol where the bid value would normally be.

Players should refer to non-power cards by their suit and bid value, for example 'red one-bid' or 'blue five-bid'.

# Set-up
Each player is dealt a personal deck of nine cards. Players may look at their personal deck, providing they shuffle it afterwards (see **Peaking at Cards** below). Each player takes the top five cards from their personal deck into their hand, which they should keep hidden from their opponent.

The 24 remaining cards form the **auction deck**, which is placed face-down between the two players. Six cards are drawn from the auction deck and placed face-up in a row next to the auction deck - these are the **auction display cards**. As the game progresses, both players will have a **personal discard pile**.

# Gameplay
## Overview
A round consists of the following phases:
1. **Set aside one card from hand** (both players simultaneously)
2. **Bid** (both players simultaneously)
3. **Use powers and purchase cards** (first the winner of the bid, then the loser of the bid)
5. **Restock auction display**
6. **Draw new hand of cards** (both players simultaneously)

The phases are explained in more detail below.

## Phase 1. Set aside one card
From their starting hand of five cards, each player chooses a single card to set aside *face down* and *on top of their personal deck* (**not** into their discard pile).

## Phase 2. Bid
Players now bid using their remaining four cards for the right to go first in phase 3.

The cards are played face down to form the player's **bid**. Players then reveal their bids simultaneously.

The total value of a players's bid is the sum of each bid card's bid value. Power cards have a bid value of zero. The player with the higher bid is the winner.

If the players' total bids tie, each player must add the top card from their personal deck to their bid. The bid values are then compared. If the bids still tie, another card is added from the top of the personal decks, and so on.

*In the diagram below, Jeanne's bid is 6+3+0+7=16. Tom's bid is 0+3+2+3=8. Jeanne wins the bid, so she will go first in phase 3.*

## Phase 3. Use powers and purchase cards
In phase three the players may A) use the power cards played in the previous round, and B) purchase cards from the auction display. The winner of the phase 2 bid goes first. Once the winner has finished both A) and B), the loser may then do the same. A) and B) may be performed in any order and any number of times - so a player could, for example, purchase a card, then use a power card, and then purchase another card; alternatively; or play two power cards but make no purchases; or do nothing at all.

### A) Use powers

Each suit has two power cards, each of which can perform all the following actions:

**Cash in any card of same suit**: Allows player to remove any card *of the same suit* in their bid from the game. Once removed, the card will no longer be part of the player's deck, but will still count towards the player's VPs at the end.

**Change a card's suit**: Allows player to temporarily change the suit of any other card in their bid. This power can change a card of the same suit into any other suit (e.g. a red power card can turn a red seven-bid into a blue seven-bid). To indicate that a card has changed suit, the power card should be placed above the altered card so that it obscures its coloured band.

**Take card of same suit from auction discard**: Allows player to look through the auction discards and retrieve a card that matches the suit of the power card. The retrieved card may then be added to the player's bid. If the retrieved card is a power card, then that power is activated. The newly-taken card should be placed below the power card, as a reminder that the power card has now been activated.

**Take card of same suit from personal discards**: As above, except player takes cards of samesuit from their *personal discards*.

**Take card of same suit from opponent's bid**: As above, except player takes card of same suit from *their opponent's bid*.

Activated power cards and any 'taken cards' remain in the player's bid and can be used to purchase cards.

*In the example below, Catherine has won the phase 2 bid with a bid value of 7+2=9. Now her blue and pink power cards can be activated. She uses the blue power card to cash in her blue two-bid, which she puts aside until the end of the game (see Clarifications for an explanation of why she may want to do this). She then uses her pink power card to take the pink two-bid from her personal discards and adds it to her bid. Her bid will now consist of four cards: a green seven-bid, a blue power card, a pink power card and a pink two-bid.*

### B) Purchasing cards

After optionally playing power cards, the player may now optionally purchase cards from the auction display, paying for them using cards from their bid.

The cost of the auction display cards is determined by their position, as illustrated below. An *n*-cost card is one that costs *n* cards from the player's offering.

![Cost of cards](diagrams/cost_of_cards.png?)

To pay for a card, the player takes the correct number of cards from their offering and puts them in either:
* their **personal discards** (if the purchased card matches the suit of the cards used to purchase it)
* the **auction discards** (if the purchased card does not match the suit of the cards used to purchase it).

The purchased cards themselves are always added to the player's *personal discards*, not to the bid.

Players may make as many purchases as they can afford. The loser of the phase 2 bid has an extra obligation: **if the one-cost auction display card was not purchased by the winner of the bid, the loser *must* purchase it.**

*In the example below, Elizabeth wants to purchase the blue four-bid card in the three-cost position of the auction display. She purchases it using  all three of her blue cards. As all of the purchasing cards match the suit of the purchased card, they are all placed in the player's personal discards, along with the purchased card.*

![Purchasing](diagrams/purchasing.png?)

If the player is purchasing a multiple-cost card, some of the cards used for purchase may end up in the player's personal discards (if they match the suit of the purchased card) while others end up in the auction discards (if they do no match).

*In the example below, Dieter first chooses to purchase the one-cost red eight-bid. He puts the purchased card in his personal discards (because that is where all purchased cards go), and the blue power card used to purchase it in the **auction** discards (because it does not match the suit of the purchased card). He then decides to purchase the two-cost green eight-bid, using his green four-bid and pink six-bid. He puts the purchased eight-bid in his personal discards, along with the green four-bid. However, the pink six-bid is placed in the auction discards, as it does not match the suit of the purchased card.*

![Purchasing](diagrams/purchasing2.png)

There may be occasions when a player will want to play a power card **after** they have made a purchase. *In the example below, Frida uses her pink three-bid to buy the pink four-bid from the auction display. She then uses her pink power card to retrieve the pink three-bid from her personal discards and return it to her bid. She finally uses the retrieved pink three-bid with her pink power card to purchase the pink eight-bid from the auction display.*

![Purchasing](diagrams/purchasing3.png??)

Further examples are given in **More about using power cards** below.

## Phase 4. Restocking the auction display

Any unpurchased cards will remain in the auction display, but will be moved to the left so that they occupy the lowest cost positions, with no gaps remaining between cards. The auction display is then restocked with new cards from the auction deck.

*In the example below, there are only three cards left in the auction display after the players have made their purchases, in the two-cost, three-cost and four-cost positions respectively. To fill in the gaps, the remaining cards are all shifted as far left as they can go, and three new cards are added from the auction deck.*

![Restocking](diagrams/restocking_auction_display.png?)

## Phase 5. Drawing a new hand of cards

Finally, players put any unused cards from their offering into their personal discards, and then draw a new hand of five cards from the top of their auction deck. (The first of the five cards to be drawn will of course be the card discarded during phase 1.)

A new round will begin, starting at phase 1.

# End of the game

Players will continue to play until there are no remaining auction display cards to buy, or neither player wants to purchase the display cards that remain.

At this point, players gather together their personal deck, discards and any 'cashed-in' cards, and then sum their total VPs. **In addition, a bonus ten VPs is awarded for any suit which a player has at least six of.**

The player with the most victory points is the winner. If players are tied for the highest score, the player with the fewest cards wins.

# Peaking at cards

During the game, players make look through their own personal discards and the auction discards, but not the discards of their opponent. In addition, they may look through their own personal deck, providing they shuffle it afterwards. It is not permitted to look through the auction deck at any time.

# More about using power cards

The following example is intended to show a more complex use of power cards.

*Femi has played two bid cards during phase 2, and having won the bid, goes on to play two power cards in phase 3. The blue six-bid allows Femi to 'cash in' another blue card, so Femi chooses to cash in his blue three-bid and puts it to aside. He then plays his blue ten-bid, which allows him to take a blue card from either the auction discards or his personal deck. He choose to take the blue nine-bid from the auction discards, which he adds to his offering, and, as it is a power card, is immediately activated, allowing him to take a blue card from his personal discards. He takes the blue seven-bid and adds it to his offering. Again, this new card is immediately activated, and allows him to duplicate a blue power card. If there were any unactivated blue power cards left in his offering, he would be able to activate the unused card twice using the duplicate power. However, all the power cards have already activated, so he uses the duplicate power to reactivate the already-activated blue six-bid a single time, which allows him to 'cash in' the blue 'fiver'. At the end of phase 3, Femi has four cards in his offerings (a nine-bid, ten-bid, six-bid and a seven-bid) with which he can purchase cards.*

# Clarifications

**Does the suit of a card matter when bidding in phase 2?** No, only the bid value of the card is relevant for bidding.

**Does the bid value of a card matter when used for purchasing a card during phase 3?** No, only the suit of a the card is relevant for purchasing.

**When you purchase a card, does the newly purchased card get added to the player's offering?**. No - whereas a power card may retrieve a card from a pile (e.g. the auction discards) and add that card to the offering, a purchased card is never added to the offering. It is always placed immediately in the player's discards.

**Why would someone use a power card to 'cash in' a card
